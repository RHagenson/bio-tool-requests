# bio-tool-requests

Requests for Bioinformatics tools people want, but nobody has built.

Unless otherwise agreed upon, the requested tool will inherit the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) from this repository.

Once development has started, the issue used to request the tool is transferred to the development repository.
